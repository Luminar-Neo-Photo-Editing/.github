Luminar Neo represents a modern approach to photo editing, integrating artificial intelligence technologies to streamline complex editing tasks while providing creative control. It addresses the time-intensive nature of traditional photo editing by automating routine enhancements like exposure correction, color balancing, and detail recovery, allowing photographers to focus on creative expression rather than technical adjustments.
